An active Big Crunch Autobuyer will Crunch immediately when reaching an Infinity Challenge's antimatter goal, regardless of settings.
All Infinity Challenges unlocked
IC1
All Normal Challenge restrictions are active at once, with the exception of the Tickspeed (C9) and Big Crunch (C12) Challenges.
Completed
Goal: 1e650 antimatter
Reward: √ó1.3 on all Infinity Dimensions for each Infinity Challenge completed
Currently: √ó8.2
IC2
Dimensional Sacrifice happens automatically every 400 milliseconds once you have an 8th Antimatter Dimension.
Completed
Goal: 1e10500 antimatter
Reward: Dimensional Sacrifice autobuyer and stronger Dimensional Sacrifice (log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(AD1)/10)^3.1 ‚ûú AD1^0.013
IC3
Tickspeed upgrades are always √ó1. For every Tickspeed upgrade purchase, you instead get a static multiplier on all Antimatter Dimensions which increases based on Antimatter Galaxies.
Completed
Goal: 1e5000 antimatter
Reward: Antimatter Dimension multiplier based on Antimatter Galaxies and Tickspeed purchases
Currently: √ó1.39e5,449,848
IC4
Only the latest bought Antimatter Dimension's production is normal. All other Antimatter Dimensions produce less (^0.25).
Completed
Goal: 1e13000 antimatter
Reward: All Antimatter Dimension multipliers become multiplier^1.05
IC5
Buying Antimatter Dimensions 1-4 causes all cheaper AD costs to increase. Buying Antimatter Dimensions 5-8 causes all more expensive AD costs to increase.
Completed
Goal: 1e16500 antimatter
Reward: All Galaxies are 10% stronger and reduce the requirements for them and Dimension Boosts by 1
IC6
Exponentially rising matter divides the multiplier on all of your Antimatter Dimensions once you have at least 1 2nd Antimatter Dimension.
Completed
Goal: 2e22222 antimatter
Reward: Infinity Dimension multiplier based on tickspeed
Currently: √ó1.66e16,306,711
IC7
You cannot buy Antimatter Galaxies. Base Dimension Boost multiplier is increased to a maximum of √ó10. (Current base multiplier: √ó10.0)
Completed
Goal: 1e10000 antimatter
Reward: Dimension Boost multiplier is increased to a minimum of √ó4
IC8
AD production rapidly and continually drops over time. Purchasing Antimatter Dimension or Tickspeed upgrades sets production back to 100% before it starts dropping again.
Completed
Goal: 1e27000 antimatter
Reward: You get a multiplier to AD 2-7 based on 1st and 8th AD multipliers.
Some Normal Challenges have requirements to be able to run that challenge.
If you have an active Big Crunch Autobuyer, it will attempt to Crunch as soon as possible when reaching Infinite antimatter.
C1
Reach Infinity for the first time outside of a challenge.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 1st Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C2
Buying Antimatter Dimensions or Tickspeed upgrades halts production of all Antimatter Dimensions. Production gradually returns to normal over 3 minutes.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 2nd Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C3
The 1st Antimatter Dimension is heavily weakened, but gets an uncapped exponentially increasing multiplier. This multiplier resets after Dimension Boosts and Antimatter Galaxies.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 3rd Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C4
Buying an Antimatter Dimension automatically erases all lower tier Antimatter Dimensions, like a sacrifice without the boost.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 4th Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C5
The Tickspeed purchase multiplier starts at √ó1.080 instead of √ó1.125.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 5th Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C6
Upgrading each Antimatter Dimension costs the Antimatter Dimension 2 tiers below it instead of antimatter. Antimatter Dimension prices are modified.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 6th Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C7
The multiplier from buying 10 Antimatter Dimensions is reduced to √ó1. This increases by √ó0.2 per Dimension Boost, to a maximum of √ó2, and is unaffected by any upgrades.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 7th Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C8
Dimension Boosts provide no multiplier and Antimatter Galaxies cannot be bought. Dimensional Sacrifice resets antimatter and all Antimatter Dimensions, but also gives a significantly stronger multiplier.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable 8th Antimatter Dimension Autobuyer
C9
Whenever you buy Tickspeed upgrades or 10 of an Antimatter Dimension, everything else of equal cost will increase to its next cost step.
Completed
Reward: Upgradeable Tickspeed Autobuyer
C10
There are only 6 Antimatter Dimensions. Dimension Boost and Antimatter Galaxy costs are modified.
Completed
Reward: Dimension Boosts Autobuyer
C11
There is normal matter which rises once you have at least 1 2nd Antimatter Dimension. If it exceeds your antimatter, it will Dimension Boost without giving the bonus.
Completed
Reward: Antimatter Galaxies Autobuyer
C12
Each Antimatter Dimension produces the Dimension 2 tiers below it instead of 1. Both 1st and 2nd Dimensions produce antimatter. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th Dimensions are made stronger to compensate.
Completed
Reward: Big Crunches Autobuyer

Antimatter generates entropy inside of this Reality. At 100% entropy, the Reality becomes destabilized and you gain a reward based on how quickly you reached 100%. Destabilizing the Reality in less than 30 seconds makes it become significantly more difficult, in exchange for giving a much stronger reward. Doing this 8 times will also give a √ó8 to Dark Energy gain.

Note: Entries are only expandable if they contain multiple sources which can be different values. For example, any effects which affect all Dimensions of any type equally will not expand into a list of eight identical numbers.
Some entries may cause lag if expanded out fully. Resizing happens over 200 ms (instead of instantly) in order to reduce possible adverse effects due to photosensitivity. This may cause some visual weirdness after prestige events.
